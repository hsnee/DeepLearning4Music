<FONT FACE=merced SIZE=5><B><U>An Early Morning Dream</U></B><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>

Wasted words<BR>
On my forked tongue<BR>
Bitter taste of sadness...<BR><BR>

Always the right words<BR>
Only two years too late...<BR>
Nothing I ever said ever changed<BR>
Anything I ever did....<BR><BR>

Never again will "I Love You"<BR>
Have any meaning behind it...<BR>
Never will the words touch my heart<BR>
Never will I feel them as I say them...<BR>
I'm broken inside.<BR><BR>

I have hurt all...<BR>
Never to be forgiven by any...<BR>
For I know what it is <BR>
To be hated by those you love the most...<BR><BR>

No tears upon my face<BR>
But frozen tears within my heart<BR>
Remind me of the pain... the love... the sadness...<BR><BR>

I never wanted to feel so empty<BR>
I never wanted to feel so unwanted...  abandoned.<BR>
I wanted you for eternity...<BR> 
Wasted words, empty heart...<BR><BR>

Frozen tears in a loving heart<BR>
Yearning to give to those I miss the most... <BR><BR>

But I stand here judged, unforgiven... <BR>
Maliciously hated by my sister...<BR>
Abandoned by my extended family... misunderstood...<BR>
Unloved by Katie....<BR><BR>

A tattoo on my arm cries my pain...<BR>
For never again shall I.<BR>
Still in love with her...<BR> 
Sad...<BR> 
Broken.... <BR><BR>

Cemetery twilight<BR>
The smell of freshly dug earth<BR>
Flickering candles light the path<BR>
The path leads nowhere........<BR><BR>

The angel statues weep with me<BR>
The flowers wilt for me<BR>
Heavy are my footsteps<BR>
Tearful are my eyes<BR>
Jasmine floats wearily upon the breeze...<BR><BR>

In darkness let me dwell<BR>
For all of my love is here<BR>
Dead and buried<BR>
As I will one day be<BR>
Overwhelming are the whispers upon the wind<BR>
Calling me to join them within the void...<BR><BR>

Crickets and katydids play a dark dirge<BR>
Welcoming me home...<BR>
Darkness reigns within my heart<BR>
And it is here that I belong...<BR><BR>

Lonely was the sad little boy in the corner.<BR>
Tears rolled quietly from his broken eyes<BR>
Death played a funeral march upon his face.<BR>
Fear of being alive tore him apart<BR>
Too fragile of a mind to comprehend his own thoughts.<BR>
A sad little boy, a broken toy lays beside him<BR>
Is all of life full of nothing but<BR>
Disappointments and shattered dreams?<BR>
All alone in an unknown world<BR>
Nobody there to even play with<BR>
Terrible fears of the world around him<BR>
Brought here against his will...<BR>
...without his permission.<BR>
The sorrow in his big brown eyes<BR>
Speaks so much more loudly than words<BR>
Of sadness, depression, disappointment, and promises broken.<BR>
Nine years old, nothing more than a fragile flower<BR>
Of what one day he will grow to be<BR>
And already he knows of pain, loneliness,<BR>
Hurt, rejection, and misery.<BR>
Lonely is the sad man in the corner.<BR>
Forgotten.<BR>

<FONT FACE=merced SIZE=5><B><U>Deepness of Love</U></B><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>
How can I prove my love for you?<BR>
How can my sincerity show through?<BR>
When I gaze upon your sweet familiar features<BR>
My spirit glows with warmth.<BR>
As I lay upon the couch and cry--<BR>
So deep is the pain inside of me for hurting you--<BR>
I can still smell your soft scent upon the fabric.<BR>
Your picture smiles down upon me, radiating such love<BR>
and beauty... so I cry some more.<BR>
I am not a wealthy man, I cannot buy you the world<BR>
To make it all better- and I know you don't want it anyway.<BR>
Deep inside I am tormented so much...<BR>
Not knowing how I could be so mean to one who is<BR>
So sweet and beautiful.<BR>
Someone who never hurt me, yet I gave so much misery.<BR>
Never before have I wanted so much to be forgiven.<BR>
But, alas, I do not know where to begin.<BR>
I want so much to heal the hurt that I have caused--<BR>
Never realizing that I could hurt so much-- myself and others--<BR>
I love you to death, and if that is where I must take this love<BR>
Then so be it, for I would die for you, I would kill for you.<BR>
I love you so much, I am so sorry.<BR>
I'm begging to be forgiven, for I have seen my evil ways.<BR>
And if I shall have to live without you, then I shall NOT live.<BR>
For I will surely die of regret and sadness,<BR>
Knowing that I hurt the only one I love and live for...<BR>
And will happily die for.<BR><BR>Lord Dellamorté<BR>February 19, 1998<BR></FONT></FONT></DL></DL></DL></DL></DL></DL></DD><BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC=barb2.gif></CENTER><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE=merced SIZE=3>The pain is destroying my entire world from the inside.<BR>
The inability to release myself from this prison of memories<BR>
Corrupts my thoughts of love and happiness.<BR>
In no way do I know how to release myself from <I>this</I> hell.<BR>
The painful memories given to me by everyone....<BR>
No longer do I want them inside of me.<BR>
The deep guilt brought forth by all I have done to those that have done to me...<BR>
It just isn't worth it.<BR><BR>
But how does one leave all those memories behind?<BR>
How to lose them instead of my mind...?<BR>
How to forgive, or more importantly, forget?<BR>
How to learn to rid oneself of the overbearing pain brought forth<BR>
By thoughtless others?<BR>
<I>How do I stop hurting others and myself?</I><BR><BR>
All I feel, all I know... is that I am slowly dying a painful death deep down inside...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE=merced SIZE=3>
Across the abysmal miles my soul cries<BR>
For love lost before it was found...<BR>
In the tender quiet of the night<BR>
I think of you....<BR><BR>

I wonder if you walk under the same stars<BR>
The same moon...<BR>
Do you feel the same fear that breathes<BR>
So heavily over my shoulder....<BR>
Carried by the lost whispers in the night?<BR><BR>

The mystical, enchanting dreams once envisioned<BR>
Are but particles of soul scattered throughout oblivion...<BR>
The calling from your soul in the midnight moonlight<BR>
Rips at my tattered mind.... gently begging me forth<BR>
To another time, another place within....<BR><BR>

To explore the moon-drenched shores of the terrifying ocean...<BR>
To hide in the night amongst the rows<BR>
And do the things we were taught not to dream of.<BR><BR>

A phobic desire to explore the melancholy-love of my soul...<BR>
To lie down in those pastures of green that haunt my mind<BR>
A never-dying desire to feel.... to breathe... the haunting unknown...<BR>
To become one with the shadows... to be the mystical trance forevermore.<BR><BR>

An age-old dream to dance within the dream and never wake...<BR>
To live forever more in the state of euphoric transcendental love...<BR>
To dream forever within the dream of psychosis...<BR>
And to fill my soul with demented actions and thoughts<BR>
That those special to me would surely damn me for. <BR>
All I ever wanted was someone to share the psychotic dreams<BR> 
Of forbidden carnal delights.... sexual deviation and dementia.<BR>
A never-ending dream of erotic pleasure...<BR><BR>

High into the deep moonlit sky<BR>
My love and feelings float<BR>
Forever searching to light down around you<BR>
In a shroud of everlasting, spiritual mysticism.<BR>
To embrace you whilst I cannot<BR>
For I am but a ghost of the man I was...<BR>
Eternally searching, internally suffering<BR>
Easy are you in my eyes, but alas,<BR>
You so easily slip through my ghostly grasp.<BR>
Damned forever to never entwine my love with yours<BR>
Hallowed is your very essence<BR>
Dark, death-romanticism and tumultuousness<BR>
What is Hell?<BR>
So silently do the bloody tears slide from my hollow eyes<BR>
So empty is my transparent touch<BR>
How disappointed I am...<BR><BR>

<font face=merced size=3>
The streets are all empty<BR>
As are the corridors of my mind.<BR>
Disconnected ghosts- so mystical in their grief<BR>
Unorthodox disdainfulness in my misanthropic self<BR>
So forlorn in my own self-abhorrence<BR>
No longer is there comfort in the spirits-<BR>
Unhallowed be my name.<BR>
For thou is Death, and I love thee... eternally.<BR>
Come to me in this bitter time of need and despair-<BR>
And tear apart my soul<BR>
Send it throughout the night to the four winds<BR>
And never let it bleed again...<BR><BR>

<font face=merced size=3>
Every second of my life<BR>
I am but one second away<BR>
From killing myself.<BR>
I have forgotten how to love<BR>
Forgotten how to live<BR>
Forgotten to care, understand, and listen<BR>
No patience are left within my bitter mind.<BR>
Other people seem to be nothing to me<BR>
Except obstacles that I must clear.<BR>
I am like this because of all the stress<BR>
That has been dumped upon me.<BR>
Inside there is not a bitter old man,<BR>
Yet my mouth opens, my face deceives me<BR>
Others think I am crazy.

The streets of my memories<BR>
Are not paved with sainthood...<BR>
Instead they are cluttered<BR>
With the souls of would-be saints.<BR>
For the gods have failed us<BR>
Or perhaps they no longer have the power to help or care<BR>
For they leave us here to suffer in pain...<BR>
And rot and die.<BR>
Forgiveness is empty...<BR>
Guilt is irrelevant.<BR>
For nothing we have ever done, are doing, or ever will do...<BR>
Will matter when we finally die.<BR>
I have lost all hope... my dreams are gone.<BR>
All I ever wanted was to love you...<BR>
Now my soul is broken.<BR><BR>

Ghosts, demons, and memories....<BR>
Haunt my every breath.<BR>
I have tried to bring the dead to life...<BR>
But they seem to live within their own death.<BR><BR>

The three that meant so much<BR>
Stood so strong and true<BR>
Watching as I threw them away<BR>
A painful memory that I relive every day...<BR><BR>

No one will let me revive them...<BR>
No one will allow me to resurrect the dead<BR>
No one will allow me to purge myself of my sin<BR>
No one will accept the love within my heart or the thoughts within my head...<BR><BR>

Wailing upon the moor of time<BR>
They call to me in the cool night<BR>
Disturbing my sleep...<BR> 
Only there to taunt, never to forget, never to forgive...<BR><BR>

Unjustly accusing me of sins I never did commit<BR>
Judge, jury, executioner...<BR> 
My punishment... to miss them forevermore...<BR>
My guilt... be my only friend... <BR>
My sorrow, regret, loneliness... be my companions...<BR>
My cross is heavy, my punishment unfair...<BR><BR>

Forever abandoned to this place of torment<BR>
My screams echoing forever throughout nothingness...<BR>
My life-- forever taunted by my love for them...<BR>
Still I love them... still I miss them... <BR>
Still I am very sad.<BR><BR>

Not a sound; no, please... not a sound...<BR>
In this timeless void... we are.<BR>
The stars, the moon- they are the ceiling...<BR>
The darkness... the walls...<BR>
And the cool, wet grass, that is the soft bed.<BR>
The cool breeze that blows ever so gently<BR>
is but a subtle reminder that all comes to change...<BR>
But as I gaze upon your beautiful face<BR>
And tell myself once again how much I love you,<BR>
Nothing else really matters.<BR>
The smile on you, as pure as a crystal stream,<BR>
And your eyes... two perfect diamonds...<BR>
I take your silky hand into mine, and smell<BR>
the soft scent of your skin<BR>
So seductive, so erotic, so hypnotic... romantic...<BR>
Say not a word... beautiful one.<BR>
Allow me to engrave your image in my mind...<BR>
To remember the smell of your skin...<BR>
And to know the beautiful feeling<BR>
of what it is to love you.<BR><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE=merced size=3>
Within the season of evil death and damnation<BR>
My soul has wandered once again to the dark side<BR>
So many thanks be given to Kate, so take my tears.<BR>
Dark realization of childhood traumas and lost evil fears.<BR>
To whither and waste away the particles of soul<BR>
That inhabit my physical being is all to do.<BR>
So forsaken by all your gods, so forsaken by you...<BR>
This is Hell, as you would believe in it...<BR>
Through my own spiritual decay, I have fought so long and hard<BR>
To obtain all that I possess--- nothing.<BR>
Through the dark night within my mind's dark eye<BR>
I travel eternally searching for the non-existing.<BR>
Never shall I understand the origin of my torment,<BR>
Never shall I be allowed to baske within the light<BR>
Nor shall I travel the path of the damned.<BR>
No, I shall forever be between the both,<BR>
Traveling in the dusk forevermore, not evil, nor good,<BR>
But suffering in between for being all that I know how to be.<BR>
Somewhere within the confines of mental and spiritual death<BR>
do I rejoice in happiness.<BR>
No souls shall or will comfort me, no demons ask upon me,<BR>
The angels have flown into the light, only to escape my empty darkness,<BR>
Gods look the other way, in shame for creating me<BR>
And I find that my existence is only in non-existence<BR>
I live only in death, death is my life...<BR>
And I am only that sad tear caught in the corner of your eye<BR>
That gracefully drops upon your love's casket<BR>
As it is lowered into the empty, dark, uncaring earth<BR>
forevermore.<BR><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE=merced SIZE=5><B><U>My Father</U></B><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>

My dad<BR>
A man that I seldom talked to.<BR>
It was that I was scared of him and did not know what to do.<BR>
I had the thought that I was never to know him<BR>
Any other way but as a father.<BR>
Only to know him as an authority figure and never a friend.<BR>
All the times he yelled and would shout<BR>
The million times he bailed me out.<BR>
The endless advice that I never listened to,<BR>
I sure would have if I only knew....<BR>
To realize that he was once my age<BR>
To realize he once had the same thoughts and feelings I do...<BR>
For 20 years I have shunned my father... too scared of him.<BR><BR>

I never gave him credit,<BR>
Never did I see<BR>
That he tried so hard because<BR>
He didn't want to be an abusive alcoholic like Grandpa was.<BR>
I thought I was a Marine for 16 years<BR>
And he was my Drill Sergeant<BR>
Screaming and spitting in my face... poking my chest with that damn finger...<BR>
And his backhand taught me nothing<BR>
His leather belt and that Matchbox car plastic racing track<BR>
Taught me nothing but hate...<BR>
And the time he broke that bamboo cane over me with one smack...<BR><BR>

But tonight I read one of his poems, "Growing Up" it was,<BR>
Written when he was my age, it made the light a bit less dim.<BR>
Finally realizing he was but a man, a person<BR>
Doing only the best he can.<BR>
Knowing he felt exactly as I do when he was my age...<BR>
I never gave him credit for what he did,<BR>
I only remember the times he was mad and I ran and hid.<BR>
I never tried to get to know this man called "dad",<BR>
Now, in my 22nd year, I am more than a little sad...<BR>
But he pushed me so far away...<BR>
We will never see eye to eye,<BR>
But I will do my best, I will give it a try,<BR>
To get to know this man that I call "Dad".<BR><BR>

Father, your love confused me<BR>
You saved my ass as many times as you whipped it...<BR>
You told me to be nice to my mom<BR>
Yet all you did was fight with her...<BR>
Never did I see you kiss her...<BR>
Or hold her... or love her...<BR>
All I saw was anger in your eyes...<BR>
And still you fight with her after 33 years<BR>
Still married, even more confusing--<BR><BR>

I did learn, I learned well<BR>
I learned that we show our love by making life Hell.<BR>
I learned of abandonment and hate when you both<BR>
Handed me over to the psycho ward and left me to rot<BR>
Because no longer could you deal with the monster you had taught...<BR>
You let mom cut my hair that I loved so much... so against my will...<BR>
And you threw away all of my memories<BR>
As you militantly cleaned my room as if I were a Marine still...<BR><BR>

At times you were a monster, other times I thought you actually cared<BR>
And I grew up to be just as loving and hostile and abusive... <BR>
Now, at 28, I struggle to overcome my hostility and hate<BR>
And I have always hoped it was never too late... to change...<BR><BR>

It destroyed me when I left my children six years ago with their mom...<BR>
And I miss them...<BR>
But I had become just like you<BR>
Just like Grandpa<BR>
A monster.<BR>
And I refuse to hurt my children the way you hurt me,<BR>
The way you let others hurt me...<BR>
And the way you embarrassed me in front of your friends...<BR>
Now I am doing the best I can... a monster-- hostile, hateful, and abusive...<BR>
You taught me well, I hope you are proud.<BR><BR>

Roses<BR>
Drip blood from their harsh thorns<BR>
Crimson tears float silenty<BR>
Down into the ground with the rain<BR>
And make their way to the darkening sea.<BR>
Roses<BR>
So beautiful in the morning dew<BR>
Sweet smell<BR>
Rising up into the mourning air.<BR>
Roses<BR>
Delightful to smell<BR>
Enticing to see<BR>
The thorns are only there<BR>
To protect their magical beauty.<BR>
So much like life<BR>
So much like love<BR>
Don't look below at the thorns<BR>
Look at the beautiful flower up above.<BR><BR><BR>

In this timeless place of erotic pleasure, I feel at home...<BR>
Amongst my friends... and I find the truest peace of mind.<BR>
Azrael sends my name upon the whispers of the wind...<BR>

Where were you<BR>
When the spirits of the dark world<BR>
Were calling to me from the<BR>
Chilling darkness of the mystical night?<BR>
Why were you not by my side<BR>
When my feelings for you were so strong?<BR>
Leaving me so alone to cry<BR>
Tears of sadness that glistened in the<BR>
Frail fingers of the moonlight<BR>
That set so heavily upon my darkening face.<BR>
Why had you left me so alone...<BR>
What was it that I had done?<BR>
Does the same moon shine down upon your familiar features...<BR>
So distant to me in this sad time...<BR>

<font size=3>The weary wanderer wanders on,<BR>
He knows not where he goes.<BR>
When it rains or when it snows,<BR>
When it's nice, or when the heavy wind blows.<BR>
He walks for all time,<BR>
Seeing people talking in mime.<BR>
He knows not where he wanders,<BR>
He knows that he does not care.<BR>
In the fire winds of a dead land<BR>
He rides the Sacred White mare.<BR>
And why, you ask him, but he cannot tell.<BR>
For all eternity he walks this flame-thrown land.<BR>
So when you pass a church and hear the toll of the bell,<BR>
Lend an ear, and you too can hear<BR>
The weary wanderer, screaming, as he wanders through Hell.<BR><BR><BR>

<font size=3>As I look towards Pikes Peak,<BR>
I see the girl I wish to seek.<BR>
Beautiful eyes and flowing brown hair.<BR>
I love her, but what does she care?<BR><BR>
I wish she loved me,<BR>
I wish she knew I existed,<BR>
I wish she would see,<BR>
Nobody loves her more than me.<BR><BR>
I long to hold her in my arms,<BR>
When the night is cold and the fire burns low.<BR>
The night is dark and down comes the snow.<BR>
But alone I sit, alone once more.<BR><BR><BR>
