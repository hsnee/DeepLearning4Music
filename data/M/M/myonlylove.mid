<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1> For years, Walker's Cay, a private island located
160 miles off the coast of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., has been the location for
WALKER'S CAY CHRONICLES, the world class fishing program seen weekly on
the Discovery Channel. It has also been featured on the TODAY SHOW as the
&quot;Shark Diving Capital of the world&quot;.  Skin Diver Magazine, Rodale's
and other publications have given this small jewel in the Atlantic some
of the best reviews ever. Now, come with us to see what all the fuss is
about!</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Today, Walker's Cay has come to mean a fabulous
&quot;get-away from it all &quot;  vacation for the diving enthusiast. With
3 boat dives a day and depths ranging from 35' to 110', Walker's offers
caverns, coral heads, underwater wrecks, drift diving and absolutely the
wildest marine life anywhere. Interactive shark dives are what Walker's
is best known for (10 years and NEVER a mishap, or even a nibble),  9' Eagle
Rays seem to be everywhere, large grouper, morays, silver- sided minnows
and practically tame barracuda seem to await every dive. Giant sea turtles
seem to stop-by and pose just for the photographer, it's truly an underwater
paradise.</FONT></CENTER></P>
