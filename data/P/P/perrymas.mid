<b>ATTENTION, BAYSIDE.NET PERSONAL WEB PAGE CUSTOMERS</b><p>
We are sorry to inform you that our upstream Internet Service Provider, Jones Internet,
who has supported us in the past, is no longer willing to host our personal
web page server.  This has been the cause of the current personal web page problems
being experienced.  This affects ONLY personal web page customers.  They have
taken over a week to let us know that they had caused these problems despite
multiple daily conversations with them.<p>

We regret this problem occured and we wish to offer several solutions.  For those
looking to have a homepage for no cost and 20 MB of storage space, please visit: <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com">http://www.fortunecity.com</a>.
To offer additional Bayside solutions, we are offering a special deal on our ECO-WEB
service to personal web page customers for $9.00/month instead of the $12.95/month and we will include as much storage for your
website as you currently were using.  If this solution interests you, please request information from
<a href="mailto:jsulzman@bayside.net">jsulzman@bayside.net</a>.<p>
Again we regret this problem.  Hopefully one of these solutions here will
be sufficient to solve your problems.<p>
Our virtual hosting solution services have been in effect for over 3 years and
we host sites for many different countries, and even 3 sites for the US White House.

Thank you for your understanding.<p>
