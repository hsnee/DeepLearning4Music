% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\section{Proposal}

\paragraph{}We plan to explore deep learning algorithms to generate music, and compare it to the already existing state-of-the-art technologies.
\paragraph{}
Often, machine learning focuses on data that is not as interpretable or expressive as music.  We would like to explore how machines represent music using cutting edge machine learning models.
\paragraph{}
There are several existing studies on this, the most well-known being a tool developed by Google Research using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, that can be trained on single streams of structured midi files. Other tools such as DeepJazz, BachBot, GRUV, WaveNet, and FlowMachines [references] also existing with varying differences such as the ability to be trained on regular audio files (wav and mp3), being particularly optimized to certain types of music, network architectures and underlying software. 
\paragraph{}
[proposed idea + approach + implementation (tensorflow?)]
\paragraph{}
[timeline/plan:] We plan on (a) acquiring and organizing data in the form of midi files representing musical structure of electronic music, (b) designing an LSTM [?] architecture to learn how to generate music based on the last 10 [?] seconds of a particular song and using its own outputs as inputs for the next prediction. We envision that this will be a classification problem where the network classifies which note (or lack of notes) to hit next. (c) train and evaluate the LSTM network on the obtained data; and (d) compare the output to that of existing tools. Magenta in particular provides the option to be trained on a user-inputted dataset, which makes it easier to compare to. We anticipate that each part will take roughly a week. [?]
